# Pneumonia-Detection

Medical applications are amongst the fastest growing areas of application of deep learning today. Clinical screening offers a particularly exciting field of use as automated, 
or semi-automated, systems could massively increase the numbers of people who can be screened. 
In this project we will build machine learning models to detect pneumonia from chest x-ray images.

In this project we will build convolutional neural network based detectors of pneumonia from chest x-ray images. 
The chest x-ray set contains a training set of 5,235 images and a test set of 627 images.
